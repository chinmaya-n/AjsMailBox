# Your Mails Organized #

One can organize the mails based on folders specified. Also, one can re-organize them by selecting the proper "Folder" they should go to. Mails information is shown on the page in multiple pages. Number of items per page can be selected using the dropbox. One can navigate any any page directly using the pagination bar. Search bar is also provided.

## Search:
You can search for all the content in mails. For example based on sender, say "Ward", result would show those having "Ward" in it. One can also seach for only mails in a particular folder. Say "Finance", result would show 6 mail senders in Finance folder.

## Selections:
Along with number of items per page, we can also filter based on Organized/Un-organzed/Both selections.
"Both" selection here will result in complete data. At any given point, say after search or so, if you want to get back to see all data you can select "Both" to reset the search results and it will show all the mails data.

## Reset Search:
Select "Both" as discussed in above section from the items per page drop down.
